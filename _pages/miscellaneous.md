Beside my mathematical interest, I love spending my time enjoying Japanese popular culture (anime, manga, JPops, anime games. Most people should understand what I'm saying right now). At the moment I mostly spend my time playing [Persona Series](https://persona.atlus.com/series/) games besides preparing for my graduate school. Even though I was engulfed to Persona recently, I just love Persona so much that I put it to [my graduation speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAUP6c8LL38&t=3160s). I have a number of games I have bought which you may see in my [Steam Account](https://steamcommunity.com/id/refrainfrn). Well... let's hope I will be able to play them all (they are expanding in each sale, haha).

# FAQ
### Why the first name Orlando?
- My mom liked [Orlando Bloom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Bloom) at the time. It was given so I can be famous like him in the future.
  
### Why the last name Ferrari?
- My last name was given as a means for me to be "quick", as it is the image of the brand [Ferrari](https://www.ferrari.com/) itself.
  
### Do you like Ferrari, the brand [Ferrari](https://www.ferrari.com/)?
- Yes, I do. However, I don't follow that much in automotive and sports related to it (F1 and others). I hope someday I will be interested in it.
  
### Are you of Italian descent?
- Nope, my parents are Indonesian and I cannot even pronounce my last name well in Italian (lol).

### Why the nickname 'Refrain'?
- Well... it started out when I was in 10th grade. I was tinkering with my last name. I came out with the name Refrain because I tend to overdo things, sort of being hyperactive at that time. Well, the formulation was changing one of the letters 'r' to 'n' in my last name and making an [anagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) of it. Hence, $$\text{Ferrari} \rightarrow \text{Ferrani} \rightarrow \text{Refrain}$$. The addition 'Fr' is for Ferrari just because.
