# I'm Orlando Ferrari! (Yes, Ferrari is my last name)

<img src='/images/Wisudapic_2025.jpg'>
A freshman dual-degree Master's math student at the University of Padova and Dauphine-PSL University for the [MAPPA curriculum](https://mappa.math.unipd.it). Currently has research interests in analysis, particularly in **topology & metric spaces, differential equations, and functional analysis**. In addition to my mathematical interest, I have over four years of experience in mathematics education as a tutor.

Prior to my undergraduate years until my 3rd year for my Bachelor's degree, I am focused to math olympiads, and it was my main source of interest to mathematics (funfact: I didn't win often before going to uni). My highest achievement at this time was being able to represent Indonesia for the [30th International Mathematics Competition](https://imc-math.org.uk) at Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria.

Starting in my final year (7th semester) as an undergraduate student, I am pursuing other means to love mathematics by striving for its beauty. During the work of my thesis, I was captivated by how we can apply mathematical results from one field--which is topology--to another field--that is, order structure--which produced an interesting problem, which was the content of [my thesis](https://etd.repository.ugm.ac.id/penelitian/detail/249432). Hence, I am more into learning various topics that somehow may unify to a spectacular result (hopefully).
